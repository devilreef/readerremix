# The Reader Remix

A short R&D project aimed at young readers, funded by [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/) under the Alternarratives programme, Summer 2020. Provides a simple DJ-like interface which readers can operate to construct a dynamic soundtrack to an audio short story.

The story in this prototype was developed as part of the project. The recordings were made at home in Edinburgh during COVID-19 lockdown. Please forgive their imperfections.
